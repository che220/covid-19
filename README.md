# COVID-19

Uses data in https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git

### Mar 6, 2019:
  South Korea and Italy: They started lockdowns. We can see the slowdown of confirmed cases in the log-scale chart.
  
  Japan: Either Japan is hiding the cases by not testing them, or Japanese are really disciplined. But I inclined to believe Japan is hiding cases
  
  US and Germany: They have not started any meaningful measures. Their cases are growing faster than exponential.
  
  France: It is very similar to Germany. But it is said China has been invited to help out. Give it a few more days to see it will deviate from Germany's curve.
