# COVID-19

Uses data in https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git

### Mar 6, 2019 (Removed cases from cruises):

    South Korea and Italy: They started lockdowns. We can see the slowdown of confirmed cases in the log-scale chart.
  
    Japan: Either Japan is hiding the cases by not testing them, or Japanese are really disciplined. But I inclined to believe Japan is hiding cases
  
    US, Germany, and France: Cases are growing exponentially.
